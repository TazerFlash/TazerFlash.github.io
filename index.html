        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am Rohan Vinod Pol, currently doing my bachelors degree in Manipal Institute of Technology, situated in Manipal, Karnataka. I am a cybersec enthusiast,
          where I mostly deal with cryptography, and also have dealt with web-exploitation. I also have played around with 3d model making softwares like CATIA,
          Fusion360, etc. I am a learner, and new learning curves are what drive me. I love to implement the stuff Ive learnt into something unique.

            <h3>Basically, I locked up</h3>
            <p>This was a challenge for my organizations annual ctf. It was about a custom made encryption algorithm that involved locking files with a password. 
              Challengers had to bruteforce the password using the plaintext, that was encrypted in the given sample code. </p>
